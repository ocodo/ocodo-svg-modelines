# Ocodo SVG modelines

A completely superfluous, but otherwise most excellent collection
of awesome modelines... if not now, then at some point in the
future, you might want, need and maybe even love these.

<sub>Don't worry if this isn't true, it's just promotional bullshit.</sub>

Very much a work in progress, these modelines are relatively
sparse, however, any info or widgets you'd like to have, please
post an issue on the github repository
https://github.com/ocodo/ocodo-svg-modelines/issues and I'll
attempt to cater to you.
